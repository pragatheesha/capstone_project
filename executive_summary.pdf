# Executive Summary - Customer Churn Analysis

## Business Context
Customer churn represents a major challenge for subscription-based businesses, as losing existing customers directly affects revenue, profitability, and long-term growth. Retaining customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project analyzes customer data to identify the key factors driving churn and to recommend actionable strategies to improve customer retention.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to:
* Understand customer behavior and churn patterns
* Identify the most influential factors contributing to churn
* Validate insights using statistical analysis
* Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce customer churn

## Data Overview
The analysis is based on a cleaned customer churn dataset containing information related to customer demographics, billing details, contract types, service usage, and churn status. The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy and reliability for analysis.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed several important insights:
* High monthly charges are strongly associated with increased churn
* Customers with short tenure are significantly more likely to churn
* Month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rates
* Long-term contracts (one-year and two-year) are linked to stronger customer retention
* Statistical testing confirms that pricing and contract structure have a significant impact on churn behavior
* These findings indicate that both pricing strategy and customer lifecycle stage play a crucial role in customer retention.

## Business Impact
Customer churn is most prevalent among new customers who are on flexible, short-term contracts and face higher monthly charges. Without targeted intervention, this group represents a high risk of continued customer loss, reducing customer lifetime value and increasing acquisition costs.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
* Introduce incentives and discounts to encourage customers to switch to long-term contracts
* Implement targeted retention campaigns for new and high-risk customers
* Review and optimize pricing strategies for customers with high monthly charges
* Enhance onboarding and early engagement programs to improve customer experience during the first year

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that customer churn is driven by identifiable and measurable factors that can be addressed through strategic business actions. By leveraging data-driven insights and focusing on high-risk customer segments, the business can significantly improve customer retention, increase lifetime value, and support sustainable long-term growth.

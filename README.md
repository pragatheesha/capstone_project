# Customer Churn Analysis – Capstone Project
## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses, as losing customers directly impacts revenue and long-term growth. This project performs an end-to-end data analysis on a customer churn dataset to identify key drivers of churn and provide actionable business recommendations to improve customer retention. The project follows a complete data analytics pipeline:
Data Cleaning → Exploratory Data Analysis → Statistical Analysis → Business Insights

## Objectives
* Clean and prepare raw customer data for analysis
* Understand customer behavior through exploratory analysis
* Identify factors influencing customer churn
* Validate insights using statistical testing
* Segment customers based on churn risk
* Provide data-driven business recommendations

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer demographic, billing, and service-related information.

Key Columns:

customerid – Unique customer identifier

tenure – Duration of customer relationship (months)

monthlycharges – Monthly service charges

totalcharges – Total charges paid by the customer

contract – Type of customer contract

paymentmethod – Payment method used

seniorcitizen – Senior citizen indicator

churn – Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No)

The dataset was cleaned and standardized before analysis.

🧹 Data Cleaning

The following steps were performed:

Standardized column names

Converted incorrect data types

Handled missing values using median and mode

Removed duplicate records

Created derived features for deeper analysis

A cleaned dataset (cleaned_customer_churn.csv) was saved for analysis.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to identify churn patterns and trends:

Churn distribution analysis

Monthly charges vs churn

Tenure vs churn

Contract type vs churn

Correlation analysis of numeric features

Visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

📉 Statistical Analysis

To validate insights, statistical tests were applied:

t-tests to compare churned vs non-churned customers

Chi-square tests to analyze categorical relationships

Correlation analysis for numeric variables

These tests confirmed that pricing, tenure, and contract type significantly influence churn.

🔍 Key Insights

Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn

New customers (low tenure) have the highest churn risk

Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn

Long-term contracts improve customer retention

Pricing and contract structure are major churn drivers

💡 Business Recommendations

Encourage long-term contracts with discounts and incentives

Target high-risk customers with personalized retention offers

Improve onboarding experience for new customers

Review pricing strategies for high-charge customers
